### **II. Character Rules**

#### **Character Creation**
To create a new character, you build your starting deck by opening two booster packs:
*   **Hero Booster Pack:** Contains 6 cards (1 Character, 1 Destiny, and 4 other random non-item cards).
*   **Treasure Booster Pack:** Contains 6 Item cards (1 Uncommon and 5 Common).
Your starting Active Deck is built from this initial pool, following all Deckbuilding Rules.

#### **Deckbuilding Rules**
An Active Deck has a limit on certain card types.
*   **Unique Card Types (Max 1 of each):**
    *   Personality
    *   Culture
    *   Species
    *   Background

    *   Destiny
*   **Multiple Copies Allowed:**
    *   Features
    *   Trainings
    *   Items
    *   Hirelings

#### **Character & Player Decks**
*   **Active Deck:** The cards that define your current character and whose abilities can be used.
*   **Side Deck:** All other cards you own. These cannot be used by your current character.
*   **Character Death:** When a character dies, all cards in their Active Deck are lost forever. Your Side Deck remains to build your next character.

#### **Crystals & Attunement**
Many cards in your Active Deck provide colored crystals, which form your character's **Crystal Pool**.
*   **Devoting Crystals:** During the Downtime Phase, you may **devote** crystals from your pool to cards that `require` them. A devoted crystal is locked into that card, enabling its abilities. You can change how your crystals are devoted during any Downtime Phase.

#### **Character Progression (Advancement)**
During the Downtime Phase, you can spend XP.
*   **5 XP:** Purchase a **Hero Booster Pack**. Add these new cards to your Active or Side Deck.

*   **Recover:** Restore all HP, MP, and SP to maximum and clear all conditions.
*   **Purchase Treasure Booster:** Spend 100 gold to buy a Treasure Booster Pack.
*   **Deck Management:** Freely swap cards between your Active and Side Decks and re-devote your Crystals.

#### **Encumbrance**
Your Load is equal to 10 + your COS score. While carrying weight greater than your Load, you have disadvantage on all physical moves (STR, DEX, CON).

#### **Acquiring Backgrounds, Friends, & Enemies**
Significant deeds or pivotal interactions can earn you new **Background**, **Friend**, or **Enemies** cards. These are added to your Active Deck after the adventure.
*   **Background Cards:** Represent your growing reputation.
*   **Friend Cards:** Forged through social success, they provide unique bonuses.
*   **Enemies Cards:** Earned by betraying or defeating significant characters, they add a persistent threat.

*   **Town/Safe Haven:** Allows Downtime and Trade actions.
*   **Hazard:** A danger that must be resolved, often with a Defy Danger roll.
